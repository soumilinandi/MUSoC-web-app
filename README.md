Project Title: Teaching the unnderprivileged (Web Page)
Project Description

Introduction

This is a simple responsive web page that provides a platform to anyone a degree or certificate as proof for knowledge in any subject to utilize their free time by teaching under privileged children in nearby areas.What this web page does is it collects information about organisations conducting meet ups around different major cities and collects information of people who are eligbile to teach.Thus it forms a meduim between the two and makes the work easier and more efficient.It has two portals,one for registering organisations around the country and another is for registering teachers with preferable citiy.
The end goal is to just create a chance for more initiative by the educated for those who don’t have access to it easily.



Timeline
 The proposed project will be carried out in separate phases. With the help of the timeline laid out the project would have a deadline in every step of the way which would help allocate the time to all the aspects of the project judiciously and would also help in the completion of the project on time
June 1st – June 4th 
    • Get to know appropriate coding standards to be followed and interact with mentors and start off the coding smoothly
June 4th – June 14th 
    • Developing the ability to write complex code in JavaScript and learn how to setup a node.js server from sources such as w3schools.com.
    • Familiarize with the development of web page frontend and backend  using reference from sites such as codecademy.com and videos from Traversy Media
    • Knowledge about Git and open source code distribution
June 14th – June 18
    • Understanding and applying general frontend techniques  to my web page web page
    • Understanding the ease of usage by the user and applying those to my design
June 19th – June 23
    • Coding the backend of my web page using node.js
June 24th – July 4th 
    • Compilation of all the coding with the help of node.js server created initially 
    • Checking the working of the site by doing a survey among friends and implementing the suggestions
June 26- June 30 ( Mid term Evaluations)
    • Mentor and students submit their evaluations of one another. These evaluations are a required step of the program. 
July 1st – July 16th 
    • Apply the improvements raised in the mid-term evaluation
    • Constantly keep pushing the code into the github repository.
    • Add comments to relevant parts of code to make it easy to read
    • Testing, documentation, code cleanup and inspection of the whole project.
July 17- July 20 (Project Submission and Final Evaluation)
    • Mentors and students submit their evaluations of one another. This is a required step of the program.
